					<h3>The Public Theater</h3>
					<img src="img/The_Public.jpeg" width="100%">
					<p>From 2017 to 2020, I was an emerging playwright for The
						Public Theater. I focused on crafting a new play
						commissioned by the institution. The play is called
						"Maybe You Should Just" with its off broadway industry
						reading last year before everything shut down. The two
						year residence was invaluable in understanding the ins
						and outs of NYC theater and gave me a once in a lifetime
						chance to gain a platform I would never have attained on
						my own.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>The Flea Theater</h3>
					<img src="img/The_Flea.jpeg" width="100%">

					<p>In the beginning of the pandemic, Theater shut down and
						committed to artists that were part of its community.
						Unfortunately, The Flea had a significant issue with the
						way they treated their artists. I became an organizer
						and artist activist to address the anti-black issues by
						helping to co-chair the Economic Justice Committee and
						the Planning Committee. We got national news ranging
						from New York Times to LA Times. The Theater shut down
						and the wripples sent waves across the city and the
						national conversation of what responsibilities theaters
						have to their artists. </p>

					<h3>Latinx Playwrights Circle</h3>
					<img src="img/The_LPC.jpeg" width="100%">

					<p>I am the Co-artistic Director for this non-profit. We are
						focusing on improving the pathetic 3% of Latinx plays
						produced in NYC over the past couple of years. Its so
						low that anything will improve where we are currently at
						right now.</p>

					<h3>Technical Support Specialist</h3>
					<img src="img/The_Columbia.jpeg" width="100%">

					<p>Since the begining of the pandemic, I have been able to
						help organizations, theaters and non-profits alike, that
						needed help jumping into digital performance and
						presentations. The theaters in New York that I have been
						able to assist range from off-broadway theaters like
						Primary Stages all the way to institutions of higher
						learning like Columbia University.</p>
				</article>
				<article class="card">
					<h3>Web Design</h3>
					<img src="img/The_Learning.jpg" width="100%">

					<p>When I stepped into the role of Co-artistic Director, as
						a leader of our volunteer staff, I wouldn't ask anyone
						anything that I wouldn't do myself. I have been pushing
						to learn more as we develop our non-profits site. And as
						we develop with more opportunities for grants, I am
						pushing to learn more about the process of Full-stack
						developer so that I can continue to not only lead my
						organiztion but partner with institutions of higher
						learning in creating a database to create resources for
						young Latinx students.</p>

					<h3>Advicate for Autism</h3>
					<img src="img/The_Olympics.jpeg" width="100%">

					<p>My brother who is 11 months younger than me has been the
						source of my learning of empathy. Over our lives, I have
						participated in Special Olympics, been a class helper
						for him, won grants for his adaptive & speech tools, and
						been (at least I think) a pretty good brother. The
						greatest benefit of growing up with Andrew was my very
						refined skills in the area of patience and in leadership
						through empathy.</p>

					<h3>The Nav Bar</h3>
					<p>This was challenging because of three reasons:
					<ul>
						<li>Sticky was not behaving with the multiple media
							queries.</li>
						<li>I was having trouble pinpointing through the console
							log where my padding for the above "About" content
							container was through my manipulation of the
							pageYOffset and the offsetTop Elements.</li>
						<li>My Nav Menu bottom border was causing spasms with
							every adjustment.</li>

					<h3>What did I do?</h3>
					<p>I had to look up because I had built it using just how I
						understand coding to work. I knew how to craft the
						javascript and understood how to make it a sticky
						toggled nav bar with the struggle of a flexbox form of
						hiding your submenu at times. The thing that I needed to
						tackle was...</p>
				</article>
				<article class="funcChild" id="Art5">
					<h3>What did I learn from this?</h3>
					<p>There was a moment of not full understanding but at least
						knowing how to fix it if that makes sense. I feel like
						so much of this journey of learning how these languages
						work within and with one another that kind of checks the
						box in a way. Like I understand how I fixed this with
						this specific function and gave me the results I wanted
						but even then I still found myself going back over the
						code and searching to see if I can make it more clear or
						more clean. And also, as I dip my toe into this vast
						amount of Selectors in basic JavaScript or branch out to
						the special types of JS... all of it is to build more to
						learning for Full-Stack and Ruby on Rails. </p>
				</article>
				<article class="funcChild" id="Art6 ">
					<h3>Where do I go from here?</h3>
					<p>I know automation and blockchain are great directions to
						go but I will wait obviously for learning Python to
						really dive into all of that. I think the technology is
						really cool, honestly. But I would love to spend a lot
						more time really fully understanding how JS works and
						opperates. If I can get to a point where I can look at a
						website and really like the design and can try to
						replicate that without hitting F12... Then I will be
						satisfied and good to move on to more Back End Coding.
